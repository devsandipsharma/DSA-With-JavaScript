# Basic Coding âœ¨âœ¨

There are some basic coding skills we need to learn before diving into DSA. In this section, we'll focus on the essential coding concepts that will serve as the foundation for our DSA journey.

## What We Will Cover ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯

* Variables: Understanding how to store and manipulate data.
* Conditional Statements: Making decisions in our code with `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
* Ternary Operators and Switch Statements: Writing concise conditions and handling multiple cases effectively.
