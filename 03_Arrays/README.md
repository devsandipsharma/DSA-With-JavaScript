# Arrays ðŸ§©ðŸ§©

`Arrays` are one of the most powerful and commonly used data structures in programming. They allow us to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently. In this section, we'll explore the core concepts and operations associated with arrays, which are essential for tackling a wide range of problems.

## What We Will Cover ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯

* Declaring and Initializing Arrays: Learn how to create arrays and initialize them with data.

* Accessing and Modifying Elements: Discover how to access and change elements in an array using indices.

* Subarrays: Extract and manipulate parts of arrays with methods like slice() and splice().

* Sorting and Reversing Arrays: Sort arrays with sort() and reverse them with reverse() to organize your data.

* Common Array Methods: Master essential methods such as push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), and more.
