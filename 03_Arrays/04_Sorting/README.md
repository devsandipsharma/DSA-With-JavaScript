# Sorting Algorithms üîÑüîÑ

`Sorting` is a `fundamental` operation in `computer science`, where the `elements` of a `list` or `array` are `arranged` in a `specific order`, usually in `ascending` or `descending order`. `Sorting algorithms` are `key` to `optimizing data processing` and are often used in `searching`, `data analysis`, and `various applications`.

## Common Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort ü´ß

* Concept: `Repeatedly compares` adjacent `elements` and `swaps` them if they are in the wrong order.

* Use Case: `Simple to implement` but `inefficient` for large datasets.

### 2. Selection Sort üîç

* Concept: `Selects the smallest (or largest)` element from the `unsorted part` of the `array` and `swaps` it with the first unsorted element.

* Use Case: `More predictable` than `Bubble Sort` but still `inefficient` for large arrays.

### 3. Insertion Sort üìù

* Concept: Builds the final `sorted array` one `element` at a `time by repeatedly inserting` the `next element` into its `correct position`.

* Use Case: `Efficient for small datasets` or nearly `sorted data`.


## Assignment Questions

### 1. Sort the Array Using Bubble Sort

**Task**: Write a program to `sort an array` in `descending order` using the `Bubble Sort` algorithm. After `sorting, return the array`.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `[4, 3, 2, 5, 1]`
- **Output**: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

**Solution**: 
To solve this problem, we use the `Bubble Sort` algorithm, where we `repeatedly compare` adjacent `elements and swap them` if they are in the `wrong order` (for descending order, swap if the first element is smaller than the second).

```javascript
function bubbleSortDescending(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            // Swap if the current element is smaller than the next element
            if (arr[j] < arr[j + 1]) {
                let temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
    return arr;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Outer Loop: Runs n-1 times where n is the length of the array. Each pass through the array places the next largest element in its correct position.

* Inner Loop: Compares each pair of adjacent elements. If the current element is smaller than the next, they are swapped.

* Descending Order: The algorithm sorts in descending order by swapping when the current element is smaller than the next one.

### 2. Sort the Array Using Insertion Sort

**Task**: Write a program to `sort an array` in `ascending order` using the `Insertion Sort` algorithm. After sorting, `return the array`.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `[4, 3, 2, 5, 1]`
- **Output**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

**Solution**: 
To solve this problem, we use the `Insertion Sort` algorithm, which `builds the sorted array` one `element at a time` by `repeatedly inserting` the next `element` into its `correct position`.

```javascript
function insertionSortAscending(arr) {
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let key = arr[i]; // The element to be positioned
        let j = i - 1;
        
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j = j - 1;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key; // Insert the key into its correct position
    }
    return arr;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Outer Loop: Starts from the second element and goes through each element in the array.

* Key: The current element (at index i) that needs to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array (from index 0 to i-1).

* Inner Loop: Shifts elements that are greater than the key one position to the right to make space for inserting the key into its correct position.

* Insertion: After shifting elements, the key is inserted at its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.

### 3. Sort the Array Using Selection Sort

**Task**: Write a program to `sort an array` in `descending order` using the `Selection Sort` algorithm. After sorting, `return the array`.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `[4, 3, 2, 5, 1]`
- **Output**: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

**Solution**: 
To solve this problem, we use the `Selection Sort` algorithm, where we `repeatedly find the maximum element` from the `unsorted portion` of the `array` and `swap` it with the `first unsorted element`.

```javascript
function selectionSortDescending(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        // Find the index of the maximum element in the unsorted part
        let maxIndex = i;
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[maxIndex]) {
                maxIndex = j;
            }
        }

        // Swap the found maximum element with the first unsorted element
        if (maxIndex !== i) {
            let temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[maxIndex];
            arr[maxIndex] = temp;
        }
    }

    return arr;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Outer Loop: Iterates through each element of the array, treating the portion of the array after the current index as unsorted.

* Find Maximum: The inner loop finds the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array.

* Swap: The maximum element is swapped with the first element of the unsorted portion, placing it in its correct position for descending order.

* Descending Order: The array is sorted in descending order by repeatedly placing the largest remaining element at the beginning of the unsorted portion.
