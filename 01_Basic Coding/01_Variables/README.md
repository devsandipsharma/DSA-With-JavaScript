# Variables ðŸ—³ðŸ—³

We can think of variables as containers or boxes where we store values. In JavaScript, we use the var, let, and const keywords to create variables.

## How to Create Variables

Creating variables in JavaScript is straightforward. We just need to give the variable a name and assign a value to it. A variable can store various types of values, such as numbers, booleans, strings, objects, and arrays.

```javascript
var name = "values";
```

## When to Use var, let, and const

* var: Used for variables that can be re-declared and updated within their scope. However, it's generally less common in modern JavaScript due to potential issues with scope.

* let: Ideal for variables that may need to be updated but not re-declared within the same scope. It has block scope, meaning it's only available within the block it was defined in.

* const: Best for variables that should not change once assigned. It also has block scope, like let.

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Add Two Variables

**Task**: Write a program to add two variables, `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` will be provided by the user, and your task is to display the sum.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `a = 3`, `b = 4`
- **Output**: `7`

**Solution**: 
To solve this problem, we can create a variable named `result` and use the `+` operator to add the values of `a` and `b`. Finally, we can log the result to the console.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    var result = a + b;
    console.log(result);
}
```

### 2. Swap Two Variables a and b

**Task**: Write a program to Swap two Variables a and b (Swapping basically means interchanging)

**Example**:
- **Input**: `a = 3`, `b = 4`
- **Output**: `a = 4`, `b = 3`

**Solution**: 
To solve this problem, we can create a `temp` variable to temporarily hold the value of `a`. Then, we assign the value of `b` to `a`, and finally, assign the value stored in `temp` to `b`.

```javascript
function swap(a, b){
    var temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;

    console.log('a value is =', a);
    console.log('b value is =', b);
}
```
