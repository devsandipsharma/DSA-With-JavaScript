# Looping ðŸ”„ðŸ”„

Looping is a fundamental concept in programming that allows us to repeat a block of code multiple times. In this section, we'll dive into the essential looping constructs that are vital for solving complex problems and optimizing our code.

## What We Will Cover ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯

* While Loop: Repeating a block of code while a condition is true.
* Do While Loop: Ensuring a block of code runs at least once, then repeating while a condition is true.
* For Loop: Iterating over a block of code a specific number of times.
* Pattern-Based Questions: Applying loops to generate and understand patterns.
