# For Loop ðŸ”„ðŸ”„

The `for loop` is a powerful control structure that allows us to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It is particularly useful when the number of iterations is known beforehand or can be determined before the loop starts.

The `for loop` consists of three parts:

* Initialization: Set up the loop counter.
* Condition: Define the condition that must be true for the loop to continue.
* Update: Modify the loop counter after each iteration.

The syntax for a for loop is:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Odd Number Series

**Task**: Write a program to print all `odd numbers` from `1` to `n` using `for loops`.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `n = 7`
- **Output**: `1 3 5 7`

**Solution**: 
To solve this problem, use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n, and check if the current number is odd. Print the number if it is odd.

```javascript
function printOddNumbers(n) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i += 2) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```

### 2. Series using for Loop

**Task**:  Print the following series using `for loop`:- `1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...` up to the number `n`.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `n = 125`
- **Output**: `1 8 27 64 125`

**Solution**: 
To solve this problem, we need to print the `cubes` of integers starting from `1` up to `n`. We can use a `for loop` to calculate the `cubes` and print them as long as the cube is less than or equal to `n`.

```javascript
function printSeries(n) {
    let cube = 1;
    for (let i = 1; cube < n; i++) {
        cube = i * i * i;
        console.log(cube);
    }
}
```
