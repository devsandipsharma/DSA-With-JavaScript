# Pattern-Based Questions ðŸ”¢ðŸ”²

`Pattern-based questions` are a common type of problem in programming that involve `generating` and `printing patterns` based on certain `rules` or `sequences`. They are useful for improving our understanding of `loops` and `control structures`.

## Trick to Solve Any Pattern-Based Question

* Identify the Number of Rows: Determine how many rows the pattern will have. This often corresponds to the outer loop in the pattern generation.

* Identify the Number of Columns and Their Arrangement: Determine how many columns are needed for each row and how they are structured. This helps in setting up the inner loop(s).

* Determine What to Print: Understand what needs to be printed in each row and column. This could be numbers, stars, spaces, or other characters.

* Find the Formula or Relationship Between Rows and Columns: Establish any formula or relationship between the rows and columns to simplify the logic of your loops and printing.

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Simple Square Pattern

**Task**: A `square pattern` where each row contains the same character.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `size = 4`
- **Output**: 
```
> ****
> ****
> ****
> ****
```

**Solution**: 
Use nested `for loops` to print a `square pattern`. The `outer loop` iterates over each `row`, while the `inner loop` generates the characters for each `column`.

```javascript
function printSquare(size) {
    for (var i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        var pattern = "";
        for (var j = 0; j < size; j++) {
            pattern += "*";
        }
        console.log(pattern);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

* Rows: The outer loop (i) runs from 0 to size - 1, creating each row of the pattern.
* Columns: The inner loop (j) runs from 0 to size - 1, adding the character * for each column in the row.
* Print: Each completed row pattern is printed after the inner loop finishes.

### 2. Right-Angle Triangle Pattern

**Task**: A `right-angle triangle` where the number of characters increases with each row.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `height = 4`
- **Output**: 
```
> *
> **
> ***
> ****
```

**Solution**: 
Use a `for loop` to iterate through each `row`, and in `each row`, use another `for loop` to print the increasing number of characters.

```javascript
function printRightAngleTriangle(height) {
    for (var i = 1; i <= height; i++) {
        var pattern = "";
        for (var j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            pattern += "*";
        }
        console.log(pattern);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

* Rows: The outer loop (i) runs from 1 to height, creating each row of the triangle.
* Columns: The inner loop (j) runs from 0 to i - 1, adding the character * for each column in the current row.
* Print: Each completed row pattern is printed after the inner loop finishes.

### 3. Pyramid Pattern

**Task**: A `pyramid` where the number of characters increases in each `row` and `is centered`.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `height = 4`
- **Output**: 
```
>    *
>   ***
>  *****
> *******
```

**Solution**: 
Use a `for loop` to iterate through each `row`, and within `each row`, use nested `for loops` to print `spaces` and `characters` to achieve the centered effect.

```javascript
function printPyramid(height) {
    for (var i = 1; i <= height; i++) {
        var pattern = "";

        // Print leading spaces
        for (var j = height - i; j > 0; j--) {
            pattern += " ";
        }

        // Print the stars
        for (var k = 0; k < (2 * i - 1); k++) {
            pattern += "*";
        }

        console.log(pattern);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

* Rows: The outer loop (i) runs from 1 to height, creating each row of the pyramid.
* Spaces: The first inner loop (j) adds leading spaces before the stars to center the pyramid.
* Stars: The second inner loop (k) adds the * characters, with the number of stars increasing by 2 for each row.
* Print: Each completed row pattern is printed after the inner loop finishes.

### 4. Diamond Pattern

**Task**: A `diamond` where the pattern `grows` and then `shrinks` symmetrically.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `size = 3`
- **Output**: 
```
>   *
>  ***
> *****
>  ***
>   *
```

**Solution**: 
Use nested `for loops` to handle the `growing` and `shrinking` parts of `the diamond`. The `upper half` of the `diamond` `grows` in `width`, and the `lower half` `shrinks symmetrically`.

```javascript
function printPyramid(height) {
    function printDiamond(size) {
    // Upper half of the diamond
    for (var i = 1; i <= size; i++) {
        var pattern = "";

        // Print leading spaces
        for (var j = size - i; j > 0; j--) {
            pattern += " ";
        }

        // Print stars
        for (var k = 0; k < (2 * i - 1); k++) {
            pattern += "*";
        }

        console.log(pattern);
    }

    // Lower half of the diamond
    for (var i = size - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        var pattern = "";

        // Print leading spaces
        for (var j = size - i; j > 0; j--) {
            pattern += " ";
        }

        // Print stars
        for (var k = 0; k < (2 * i - 1); k++) {
            pattern += "*";
        }

        console.log(pattern);
    }
}
}
```

**Explanation**:

* Upper Half:
    * Rows: The first for loop (i) runs from 1 to size, creating each row of the top part of the diamond.
    * Spaces: The first inner loop (j) adds leading spaces to center the stars.
    * Stars: The second inner loop (k) adds the * characters, increasing by 2 for each row.

* Lower Half:
    * Rows: The second for loop (i) runs from size - 1 to 1, creating each row of the bottom part of the diamond.
    * Spaces: The first inner loop (j) adds leading spaces to center the stars.
    * Stars: The second inner loop (k) adds the * characters, decreasing by 2 for each row.
    
* Print: Each completed row pattern is printed after the inner loops finish.

### 5. Hollow Pyramid Star Pattern

**Task**: Create a `hollow pyramid` pattern where the pyramid has stars `*` on the borders and spaces in between. The pattern should be centered and the number of rows determines the height of the pyramid.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `size = 4`
- **Output**: 
```
>    *
>   * *
>  *   *
> *******
```

**Solution**: 
Use nested for loops to handle the pyramid structure, and print * for the borders and spaces in between.

```javascript
function printHollowDiamond(height) {
    for (var i = 1; i <= height; i++) {
        var pattern = "";

        // Add leading spaces
        for (var j = 1; j <= height - i; j++) {
            pattern += " ";
        }

        // Add stars and spaces
        for (var k = 1; k <= 2 * i - 1; k++) {
            if (i === height) {
                pattern += "*"; // Fully filled last row
            } else if (k === 1 || k === 2 * i - 1) {
                pattern += "*"; // Edges of the diamond
            } else {
                pattern += " "; // Hollow center
            }
        }

        console.log(pattern);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

* Outer Loop: Iterates through each row of the pyramid from 1 to size.
* Leading Spaces: Added to center the pyramid. The number of spaces decreases as we move down the pyramid (size - i spaces).
* Stars and Spaces:
    * For the last row (i === size), the entire row is filled with *.
    * For other rows, * is printed at the first (k === 1) and last (k === 2 * i - 1) positions, with spaces in between.
