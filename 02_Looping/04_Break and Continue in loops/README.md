# Break and Continue in Loops ðŸ”„ðŸ”„

In JavaScript, `break` and `continue` are control flow statements that can be used to `alter the execution flow within loops`. Understanding how to use these statements effectively allows for more flexible and controlled `looping`.

## Break Statement

The `break statement` is used to terminate the nearest enclosing loop or `switch statement`. When a `break statement` is encountered, the `loop` or `switch statement` is immediately exited, and control is transferred to the statement following the `loop` or `switch`.

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
    if (conditionToBreak) {
        break;
    }
    // more code
}
```

## Continue Statement

The `continue statement` is used to `skip the current iteration` of a `loop` and proceed to the `next iteration`. When a `continue statement` is encountered, the rest of the code inside the `loop` for the current iteration is skipped, and control is transferred to the `loopâ€™s condition check` for the next iteration.

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
    if (conditionToContinue) {
        continue;
    }
    // more code
}
```

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Program to Print Numbers and Stop at m

**Task**: Write a program to print all numbers from `1` to `n`. If `m` is present in the sequence, stop printing any other numbers and `break` out of the `loop`.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `n = 10`, `m = 4`
- **Output**: `1 2 3`

**Solution**: 
Use a `for loop` to iterate from `1` to `n`. Check if the current number equals `m`. If it does, use the `break statement` to exit the `loop` and stop printing further numbers.

```javascript
function printNumbersUntil(m, n) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i === m) {
            break;
        }
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```

### 2. Program to Print Even Numbers Skipping Multiples of 4

**Task**: Write a program to print even numbers from `1` to `n`, skipping any numbers that are divisible by `4`. Use `the continue statement` to skip printing those numbers.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `n = 10`
- **Output**: `2 6 10`

**Solution**: 
Use a `for loop` to iterate from `1` to `n`. Check if the number is even and not divisible by 4. Use `the continue statement` to skip the number if it is divisible by `4`.

```javascript
function printEvenNumbersSkippingMultiplesOfFour(n) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 !== 0) {
            continue;
        }
        if (i % 4 === 0) {
            continue;
        }
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```
