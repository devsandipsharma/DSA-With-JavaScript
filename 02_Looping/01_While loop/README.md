# While loop ðŸ”„ðŸ”„

The `while loop` allows us to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. This type of loop is particularly useful when the `number of iterations isn't known` beforehand and needs to be determined dynamically during runtime.

The `while loop` checks the condition before executing the block of code. If the condition is true, the loop continues to execute until the condition becomes false.

```javascript
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}
```

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Find Even Numbers

**Task**: Write a program using only `while loops` to print all the even numbers from `1` to `n`.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `n = 10`
- **Output**: `2 4 6 8 10`

**Solution**: 
To solve this problem, we'll start with the number 2 (the smallest even number) and increment by 2 each time using a while loop until we reach or exceed the value of n.

```javascript
function printEvenNumbers(n) {
    let i = 2;
    while (i <= n) {
        console.log(i);
        i += 2;
    }
}
```

### 2. Armstrong number

**Task**: Write a program to print whether a given number is an `Armstrong number or not`..

**Example**:
- **Input**: `n = 153`
- **Output**: `true`

**Solution**: 
An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because:
```
> 1 * 1 * 1 + 5 * 5 * 5 + 3 * 3 * 3
> 1 + 125 + 27
> 153
```

We can solve this by calculating the sum of the digits, each raised to the power of three (since weâ€™re dealing with a three-digit number), and then comparing this sum to the original number.

```javascript
function isArmstrongNumber(n) {
    let sum = 0;
    let temp = n;

    while (temp > 0) {
        let digit = temp % 10;
        sum += digit * digit * digit;
        temp = Math.floor(temp / 10);
    }

    return sum === n;
}
```
