# Bit Manipulation and Complexity 💡🔍

Understanding bit manipulation and complexity is crucial for optimizing algorithms and solving problems efficiently. This chapter delves into how to use bitwise operations, and analyze time and space complexity, and work with strings.

## What We Will Cover 🎯🎯

* Bit Manipulation: Techniques for performing operations at the bit level. Includes operations like `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, and `bit shifts`. Learn how to use these operations to solve problems more efficiently.

* Time and Space Complexity: Analyzing the efficiency of algorithms. Understand `Big O notation` to evaluate how an algorithm scales with input size. Learn to distinguish between different complexity classes and their impact on performance.

* Strings: Operations and techniques for manipulating `strings`.
