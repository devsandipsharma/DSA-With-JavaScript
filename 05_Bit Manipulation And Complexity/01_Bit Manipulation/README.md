# Bit Manipulation ðŸ§©ðŸ’»

`Bit manipulation` involves performing operations on the binary representations of numbers. Itâ€™s a powerful technique for optimizing performance and solving problems efficiently by working directly with bits.

## Convert Decimal to Binary

To convert a `decimal number` to `binary`, repeatedly divide the number by `2` and record the `remainder`. The `binary representation` is the `sequence of remainders` read in `reverse order`.

- **Example**:

    - **Decimal**: `13`

    - **Binary**: `1101`

- **Explanation:**
    ```
    >> 13 Ã· 2 = 6, remainder = 1
    >> 6 Ã· 2 = 3, remainder = 0
    >> 3 Ã· 2 = 1, remainder = 1
    >> 1 Ã· 2 = 0, remainder = 1
    ```
Read the remainders from bottom to top: `1101`.

## Convert Binary to Decimal

To convert a `binary number` to its `decimal form`, we can `multiply each bit by 2` raised to the `power of its position` and then `sum the results`.

- **Example:**

    * **Binary**: `1010`

    * **Decimal**: `10`

- **Explanation** : 
    ```
    >> 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0
    >> 8 + 0 + 2 + 0
    >> 10
    ```

## Binary Arithmetic

### Addition of Binary Numbers

Adding `binary numbers` follows the same principle as decimal addition, but it carries over `1` whenever the sum of two bits exceeds `1`.

- **Example:**

    - **Binary Addition**: `1011` + `1101`

    - **Steps**:
        ```
        >> 1 + 1 = 0 (carry 1)
        >> 1 + 0 + 1 = 0 (carry 1)
        >> 0 + 1 + 1 = 0 (carry 1)
        >> 1 + 1 = 1 (carry 1)
        >> Result : 11000
        ```

### Subtraction of Binary Numbers

`Binary subtraction` can be efficiently performed using the `2's` complement method. This method is a clever way to handle subtraction by converting the number to be subtracted (the subtrahend) into its `2's` complement form and then adding it to the number we are subtracting from (the minuend).

- **Example:** Subtract `5` `(0101â‚‚)` from `12` `(1100â‚‚)`

- **Steps:**

    * Find the `1â€™s` complement of the subtrahend `(5)`:

        * Subtrahend: 0101â‚‚

        * 1â€™s Complement: 1010â‚‚

    * Add 1 to get the 2â€™s complement:

        * 1010â‚‚ + 1â‚‚ = 1011â‚‚

    * Add the 2â€™s complement of the subtrahend to the minuend:

        * Minuend: 1100â‚‚

        * 2â€™s Complement: 1011â‚‚

        * 1100â‚‚ + 1011â‚‚ = 10111â‚‚

    * Result:

        * Ignore the carry (leftmost 1), leaving the result as 0111â‚‚.

    * Convert the result back to decimal:

        * 0111â‚‚ = 7
        
        * So, 12 - 5 = 7 using binary subtraction with 2's complement.

## Bitwise Operators

`Bitwise operators` perform operations directly on the `binary representations` of numbers. These include:

### AND (&) 

The `AND operator` compares each bit of two numbers and returns 1 if both bits are `1`; otherwise, it returns `0`.

- **Example:**

    ```javascript
    let a = 5;  // Binary: 0101
    let b = 3;  // Binary: 0011

    let result = a & b;  // Result: 0001 (Decimal: 1)
    ```

### OR (|)

The `OR operator` compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` if at least one of the bits is `1`; otherwise, it returns `0`.

- **Example:**

    ```javascript
    let a = 5;  // Binary: 0101
    let b = 3;  // Binary: 0011

    let result = a | b;  // Result: 0111 (Decimal: 7)
    ```

### XOR (^)
The `XOR operator` compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` if the bits are different, and `0` if they are the same.

- **Example:**

    ```javascript
    let a = 5;  // Binary: 0101
    let b = 3;  // Binary: 0011

    let result = a ^ b;  // Result: 0110 (Decimal: 6)
    ```

### NOT (~)

The `NOT operator` inverts each bit of the number, turning `1s` into `0s` and `0s` into `1s`. This operation returns the two's complement of the number.

- **Example:**

    ```javascript
    let a = 5;  // Binary: 0101

    let result = ~a;  // Result: 1010 (Decimal: -6)
    ```

### LEFT SHIFT (<<)

The `LEFT SHIFT` operator shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, filling the vacant positions with `0s`.

- **Example:**

    ```javascript
    let a = 5;  // Binary: 0101

    let result = a << 1;  // Result: 1010 (Decimal: 10)
    ```

### RIGHT SHIFT (>>)
The `RIGHT SHIFT` operator shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.

- **Example:**

    ```javascript
    let a = 5;  // Binary: 0101

    let result = a >> 1;  // Result: 0010 (Decimal: 2)
    ```

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Find Odd and Even Numbers

**Task**: Write a program to determine if `numbers` in an `array` are `odd` or `even` using bit manipulation.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `[4, 3, 2, 5, 1]`
- **Output**: `[4, 2]` for even numbers and `[3, 5, 1]` for odd numbers

**Solution**: 
To solve this problem using bit manipulation, we will use the bitwise `AND operator (&)` to check if a number is odd or even. The least significant bit of an integer determines if it is odd or even. If the least significant bit is `1`, the number is odd; if it is `0`, the number is even.

```javascript
function findOddEvenNumbers(arr) {
    var evenNumbers = [];
    var oddNumbers = [];
    
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        // Use bitwise AND with 1 to check if the number is odd
        if (arr[i] & 1) {
            oddNumbers.push(arr[i]); // Number is odd
        } else {
            evenNumbers.push(arr[i]); // Number is even
        }
    }
    
    console.log("Even Numbers:", evenNumbers);
    console.log("Odd Numbers:", oddNumbers);
}
```

### 2. Swap Two Numbers

**Task**: Write a program to `swap two numbers` using bit manipulation.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `a = 5, b = 9`
- **Output**: `a = 9, b = 5` 

**Solution**: 
To swap two numbers using bit manipulation, we can use the `XOR bitwise operator (^)`. `XOR` can be used to swap values without needing a temporary variable.

```javascript
function swapNumbers(a, b) {
    // Print initial values
    console.log("a = " + a + ", b = " + b);
    
    // Step 1: XOR a and b and store in a
    a = a ^ b;
    
    // Step 2: XOR the result with b to get the original value of a
    b = a ^ b;
    
    // Step 3: XOR the result with the new value of b to get the original value of b
    a = a ^ b;
    
    // Print swapped values
    console.log("a = " + a + ", b = " + b);
}
```
